# Train Track With Drawbridge
As a final project for the MAE412 Microprocessors class, built a computer from scratch by soldering chips and wires on a breadboard and programmed in assembly to write a standalone program to control a self-designed model train track. The metrics to measure success included robustness, hands-free, reliable operation, workmanship, documentation, project progress, and degree of difficulty/effort. The timeline for the final project included 6 weeks of in-class lab time and 2 weeks of self-guided work during finals period concluded by a day of final projects demonstrations to the course instructors and fellow classmates.
